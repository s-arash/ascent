//! DefUse Chains with Composed Types
//!
//! The following example utilizes a composed type to model a type hierarchy for instructions.
//!
//! In this example an instruction is either a `Read`` operation, a `Write` operation or a `Jump` instruction.
//!
//! However, to model the control flow through instructions, the flow relation needs to be able to
//! cover any of those.
//!
//! To model this situation, the union type Instr is introduced and utilized as shown above.
//!
